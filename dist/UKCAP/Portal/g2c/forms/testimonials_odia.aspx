  <p class="mb-0">The establishment of Common Application Portal (CAP) represents a significant breakthrough in delivery of public service to the citizens. There is a plethora of Government Schemes to promote livelihood, health, sanitation, nutrition, education, housing, social security and strengthen agriculture, industry and infrastructure. However, the impact of the programme is constrained by difficulties in access to service by the citizens.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">It is very convenient for a common man to apply for pension under 'National Social Assistance Programme' and 'Madhu Babu Pension Yojana' at the nearest Common Service Centre by paying only Rs.10/-.Previously they had to go Block Office again and agin, Now this will give them a time limit in which their application can be addressed. This will indeed be a great initiative of CMGI under the General Administration Department.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">The Online Services for Development of Inland Fisheries through Blue Revolution (Fresh Water & Brackish water) and Motorization of Traditional Craft, under the Odisha Common Application Portal will be a great help to the citizens of Odisha for availing these services electronically in a time bound manner. Hence, the mandate of 'Odisha Right to Public Services Act' can be achieved. Essentially appreciate the initative of CMGI for Hassle-free Endeavour.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">I am confident that the online applicatio fr 1.Motorisation of Traditional Craft and 2.Development of inland Fisheries through Blue Revolution (Fresh Water and Brackish water) will be much convenient for any citizen of our State by paying only Rs.10/- in the nearby Common Service Centre, Hence-forth the citizen need not have to come to Block/District/Directorate for pursue of their application. As these services are notified under ORTPSA it will be much easier for District Fisheries Officer to deliver the service within the timeline.</p>

  <p class="mb-0">State Council for Technical Education & Vocational Training (SCTE&VT), Odisha being the affiliating body of Diploma Education provides various services to the students. Six services of SCTE&VT have been notified under Odisha Right To Public Service Act-2012. Presently Diploma students apply for services manually through their respective institutions which is a time consuming process.Under the new e-initiative, now students can apply online for their Mark sheets / Diploma Certificate/ Migration Certificate etc. and receive the same online.</p>
